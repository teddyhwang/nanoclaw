 *
 * Two isolation layers, applied in order:
 *
 * 1. Task/chat isolation — if any trigger=1 task row is present, drop
 *    ALL chat/chat-sdk rows. Without this, silent-maintenance tasks
 *    ("do NOT send any messages") get chat shoved into the prompt and
 *    the model overrides the silence instruction to reply to what looks
 *    like a live user turn. Two motivating incidents:
 *      - 2026-05-11 04:01 (shit-talk): mackchiu's trigger=0 accumulate
 *        chats from the prior evening dragged into the 04:02 maintenance
 *        wake; agent posted a chat reply despite the silent-task
 *        instruction.
 *      - 2026-05-16 13:22 (AI Friends dream leak): the original fix's
 *        hole — `taskOnlyWake = triggerRows.every(kind==='task')` missed
 *        the case where AI-Friends mention-sticky chat was marked
 *        trigger=1. Now isolation triggers on *any* task trigger, and
 *        defers chat rows regardless of their trigger flag (sticky-
 *        engage chat is still chat).
 *
 * 2. Dream-only isolation — if any dream-series row (`series_id` starts
 *    with `dream-`) is in the post-step-1 batch, defer every non-dream
 *    row too. The dream's silent `<internal>` summary must be the only
 *    result event in the stream so per-push attribution can route the
 *    text to the dream's fire context. Without this, a co-arriving
 *    non-dream task (recap/status-update/RSS — anything that registered
 *    AFTER the dream) wins attribution when the result lands and the
 *    dream fire row ends with `assistant_text=''`. Observed 2026-05-25,
 *    `ag-1778154011329-g9zust` (Degenerate Server): dashboard showed
 *    "Silent fire — no output captured" for a dream that ran correctly.
 *    The dream is silent-by-design — deferring co-arrivers costs at
 *    most one poll tick before they get their own clean stream.
 *
 * 3. Reaction-only-wake isolation — if the only trigger=1 rows are
 *    reactions, defer every trigger=0 chat row. A reaction on the agent's
 *    own message is a deliberately *soft* trigger (`evaluateReactionEngage`
 *    on the host): someone acknowledged something the agent said. It is not
 *    a request to answer the conversation that happened since. Without this
 *    layer the soft wake flushes the entire accumulated ambient backlog into
 *    the turn as fresh input, and the model — correctly seeing unanswered
 *    human messages — replies to them.
 *      - 2026-08-20 13:25 (shit-talk): four minutes of ambient chat
 *        accumulated as trigger=0 after the agent's last answer. A 😂 on
 *        the agent's OWN earlier message woke it; all 7 accumulated rows
 *        rode along, and the agent posted an unprompted joke about Teddy's
 *        ambient "We should ask Hyung". Teddy: "you responded even though
 *        you weren't triggered to."
 *    Same shape as layer 1's 2026-05-11 shit-talk incident (accumulate
 *    dragged into a maintenance wake), one layer over. The deferred rows
 *    stay pending and are picked up by the next real trigger, so no context
 *    is lost — it just stops being an implicit licence to reply. A trigger=1
 *    chat row (a real @mention / reply-to-bot) anywhere in the batch means
 *    this is a genuine chat turn and no isolation applies.

  // serve them in that order. Each result picks the OLDEST push that
  // still has an unwritten context, then the newest unwritten context
  // within that push.
  //
  // Why push-scoped beats the prior "most recent unwritten overall":
  //   On 2026-05-25 a Degenerate-Server dream task fired in the initial
  //   batch alongside 30+ gated recap claims; later a real recap task +
  //   a chat-sdk turn arrived as separate follow-up pushes. With "most

  //   `mostRecentTaskContext()` when the agent's `result.text` (which
  //   was actually the dream's `<internal>` summary) landed — text was
  //   attributed to the chat task, dream context flushed empty,
  //   dashboard showed "Silent fire — no output captured" for the dream
  //   even though it ran correctly.
  //
  //   Push-scoping makes the initial-batch dream context the only
  //   eligible target for the first result; the chat-sdk follow-up only
  //   becomes eligible after the dream context is written.
  //
  // Paired with the dream-only isolation block above (an initial batch
  // with a dream row defers all non-dream rows), the canonical dream
  // case is now structurally clean: dream is the lone context in push 0,
  // its result attributes to it, fire row carries the `<internal>`
  // summary.
  //
  // Errors set `streamErrored` so the finally skips the normal-completion
  // write; the outer catch in startMessageLoop writes one error fire per
  // unwritten context instead.
  //
  // Each entry is the contexts registered during a single push (initial
  // batch at index 0, each subsequent `query.push` appends a new entry).

 * care which row produced it.
 *
 * `inReplyTo` is filtered: never a `kind='task'` row (id is a synthetic
 * UUID, not a platform message id — using it leaks a "reply to nothing"
 * pill that Discord falls back to the channel's most-recent real message
 * for, observed 2026-05-11 + 2026-05-13) and never a `trigger=0`
 * drive-by (accumulate-only chat that the agent isn't actually answering
 * — using it makes maintenance-task posts render as a reply to whoever
 * happened to chat most recently). Same exclusion shape as
 * `pickInReplyToMessage` in formatter.ts. If no matching `trigger=1`
 * non-task row exists, returns `inReplyTo: null` so the post lands as a
 * standalone message — the safer of the two failure modes.
